In the project directory, you have to run:

### `npm install`

Installs all the dependencies that needs the project

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br>
Open [http://localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080) to view it in the browser.

### `npm run build`

Run this command if you want to deploy this app in a real server.<br>
I already did this, so you can visit [https://kind-goldstine-1abd26.netlify.com/](https://kind-goldstine-1abd26.netlify.com/) to see the app without installing anything ðŸ˜Š ðŸŽŠ ðŸŽ‰
